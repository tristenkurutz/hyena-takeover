# Hyena Takeover
Have you ever wanted to (with permission) change your friend's wallpaper to a hyena (or any other image) with a double-click of a file? Say no more!

## How?
Send one of the executable files in releases to your friend!

or, if you want to change the image:

<ol>
<li>Change <code>wallpaper.jpg</code> to a file of your choosing.</li>
<li>Run the Makefile using your favorite <code>make</code> utility, which will compile your image to a byte array and create executables for each common OS.</li>
<li>Send the executable to your friend! (with their knowledge!)</li>
</ol>

## There's a catch...
The Linux version uses <code>gnome</code> or <code>swww</code> commands to set the wallpaper, which wonâ€™t work on all Linux distributions or desktop environments. So, Linux friends may have limited support. :(
